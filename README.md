# Tournament Manager

A project for creating a new Poker Tournament Manager website and app for running a poker league.

1. Blazor
2. Separation of concerns with Repositories and Unit of Work
3. Unit testing
4. SignalR
5. .net Maui
6. Authentication and authorisation across the different app types
7. Tailwindcss

Further goals
1. Multi tenancy
