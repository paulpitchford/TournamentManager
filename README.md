# TournamentManager

A project for creating a Poker Tournament Manager website and app for running a poker league.

What I'm hoping to learn along the way:

1. Blazor
2. Separation of concerns with Repositories and Unit of Work
3. Unit testing
4. .net Maui
5. Authentication and authorisation across the different app types

Further goals
1. Multi tenancy
